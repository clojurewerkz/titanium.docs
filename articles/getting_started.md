## What version of Titanium does this guide cover?

This guide covers Titanium 1.0.x.


## Titanium Overview

Titanium is a Clojure graph library build on top of [Aurelius
Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/). It is easy
to use, strives to support every Titan feature, supports multiple
storage backends (Cassandra, HBase, BerkeleyDB Java Edition), takes
the "batteries included" approach and is well maintained.

 * [Big Graph Data With Cassandra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkAYA4Kd8JE)


### What Titanium is not

Titanium is not a database. It relies on other data store engines to
take care of on-disk durability.Titanium's value is in providing an
expressive Clojure API for graph operations.

Titanium is not an ORM/ODM. It does not provide graph visualization
features, although this is an interesting area to explore in the
future versions. Titanium may or may not be Web Scale and puts
correctness and productivity above sky high benchmarks.


## Supported Clojure versions

Titanium is built from the ground up for Clojure 1.3 and later. The most recent
stable release is always recommended.



## Adding Titanium Dependency To Your Project

### With Leiningen

    [clojurewerkz/titanium "1.0.0-alpha1"]

### With Maven

Add Clojars repository definition to your `pom.xml`:

{% gist 65642c4b53d26539e5f6 %}

And then the dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>clojurewerkz</groupId>
      <artifactId>titanium</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0-alpha1</version>
    </dependency>

It is recommended to stay up-to-date with new versions. New releases and important changes are announced [@ClojureWerkz](http://twitter.com/ClojureWerkz).


## A Very Short Intro To Graph Databases

Graph is a data structure that represents connections (or lack of
them) between things. Connected things are called "vertices" or
"nodes" and connections are called "edges" or
"relationships". Vertices may have properties (like person name or
age), same for edges (for example, when two people first met
each other). There may be more than one edge between two
nodes. Edges are directed (have a start and an end; for
example, Web pages link to each other).


## Opening a Graph

Titanium is built on top of Titan which can be configured, for example, to use different durable storage
backends:

 * [BerkeleyDB Java Edition](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index-093405.html)
 * [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org)
 * [Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org)

as well as in-RAM storage (used primarily for automated testing and experimentation in the REPL).

Titan configuration is typically file-based. `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/open` is a polymorphic
function that accepts

 * Clojure maps where keys are configuration properties
 * Paths to configuration (`.properties`) files as strings or `java.io.File` instances
 * Paths to local DB directories as strings or `java.io.File` instances


### In-Memory Graph DB

In-memory graph can be obtained using the `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/open-in-memory-graph` function:

``` clojure
(ns myservice.graphs
  (:require [clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg]))

(defn- main
  [& args]
  ;; opens an in-RAM graph database
  (let [g (tg/open-in-memory-graph)]
    (comment Work with the graph here)))
```


### Local Graph DB

To use BerkeleyDB backend, pass a local database path as a string or a path to
a `.properties` file that [configures Titan to use BerkeleyDB](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/wiki/Using-BerkeleyDB)
to `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/open`.

An example suitable for testing and REPL experimentation:

``` clojure
(ns myservice.graphs
  (:require [clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg]))

(defn- main
  [& args]
  ;; opens a BerkeleyDB-backed graph database in a temporary directory
  (let [g (tg/open (System/getProperty "java.io.tmpdir"))]
    (comment Work with the graph here)))
```

Note that BerkeleyDB will lock directory it uses, so only one JVM can access a directory
at a time. If you have a BerkeleyDB-backed database open in the REPL, this may prevent
you from running tests or apps on the command line.

### Cassandra-backed Graph DB

To use BerkeleyDB backend, pass a path to
a `.properties` file that [configures Titan to use Cassandra](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/wiki/Using-Cassandra)
or a Clojure map of configuration properties. Keys that are relevant for the Cassandra
backend are

 * `"storage.backend"`: must be `"Cassandra"`)
 * `"storage.hostname"`: a host where a Cassandra node is running
 * `"storage.keyspace"`: keyspace Titan will use (default: `"titan"`)
 * `"storage.read-consistency-level"`: consistency level for reads (default: quorum)
 * `"storage.write-consistency-level"`: consistency level for writes (default: quorum)
 * `"storage.replication-factor"`: how many nodes will store replicas of the data. Default is 1, 3 recommended for
   production use.

An example:

``` clojure
(ns myservice.graphs
  (:require [clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg]))

(defn- main
  [& args]
  (let [g (tg/open {"storage.backend"  "Cassandra"
                    "storage.hostname" "127.0.0.1"
                    "storage.keyspace" "myapp_development"})]
    (comment Work with the graph here)))
```

For more information, consult [Titan documentation on the Cassandra backend](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/wiki/Using-Cassandra).

### HBase-backed Graph DB

TBD


## Creating Vertices

Vertices are created using the `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/add-vertex` function:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(tg/add-vertex g {:name "Titanium" :language "Clojure"})
```

The same example in context:

``` clojure
(ns myservice.graphs
  (:require [clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg]))

(defn- main
  [& args]
  ;; in-RAM graph database used here only for demonstration
  (let [g (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
        v (tg/add-vertex g)]
    (comment ...)))
```

Vertices typically have properties. They are passed to `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/add-vertex` as maps:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(tg/add-vertex g {:name "Titanium" :language "Clojure"})
```


## Working With Vertex Properties

### Getting a Map of Properties

Vertices in Titanium are *mutable objects*. However, it is easy to obtain an immutable Clojure map of
their properties using `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/properties-of`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/properties-of v)
```

Example in context:

``` clojure
(ns myservice.graphs
  (:require [clojurewerkz.titanium.graph    :as tg]
            [clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te]))

(defn- main
  [& args]
  ;; in-RAM graph database used here only for demonstration
  (let [g (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
        v (tg/add-vertex g {:name "Titanium" :language "Clojure"})]
    ;= {"name" "Titanium" "language" "Clojure"}
    (te/properties-of v)))
```

Note that returned maps always have strings as keys.

### Getting A Single Property

To get a single property value, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/property-of`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/property-of v :name)
```

To get id of a vertex, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/id-of`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/id-of v)
```

### Listing Property Names

To obtain a list of property names, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/property-names`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/property-names v)
```

### Mutating Properties

Because vertices in Titanium are mutable, functions that mutate their properties are named
with an exclamation point ("bang") at the end, like [Clojure transients](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/collections_and_sequences.html#transients).

To mutate one or more properties on a vertex, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/assoc!`, which
mimics [clojure.core/assoc!](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/assoc!):

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/assoc! v "status"     "crawled"
             "crawled-at" date)
```

To merge a map (or multiple maps) into the map of vertex properties, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/merge!`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/merge! v {"status"    "crawled"
             "crawled-at" date})
```


### Unsetting Properties

To clear a property (set its value to `nil`), use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/dissoc!`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/dissoc! v "status" "crawled-at")
```

To clear all properties on a vertex, there is `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/clear!`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/clear! v)
```

## Removing Vertices

To remove a vertex, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/remove-vertex` which takes
a graph instance and a vertex:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [v (tg/add-vertex g {:name "Titanium" :language "Clojure"})]
  (tg/remove-vertex g v))
```


## Creating Edges

Now that we know how to create vertices, lets create two vertices representing two Web pages that link to each other and add a directed
edge between them. To do that, we need to use the `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/add-edge` function:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [p1 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "ClojureWerkz" :url "http://clojurewerkz.org"})
      p2 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "Titanium"     :url "http://titanium.clojurewerkz.org"})]
  (tg/add-edge g p1 p2 "links"))
```

Edges can have properties, just like vertices:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [p1 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "ClojureWerkz" :url "http://clojurewerkz.org"})
      p2 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "Titanium"     :url "http://titanium.clojurewerkz.org"})]
  (tg/add-edge g p1 p2 "links" {:verified-on "February 11th, 2013"}))
```



## Working With Edge Properties

### Getting a Map of Properties

Just like vertices, edges in Titanium are *mutable objects*. To obtain an immutable Clojure map of
their properties, use the same function, `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/properties-of`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/properties-of e)
```

Example in context:

``` clojure
(ns myservice.graphs
  (:require [clojurewerkz.titanium.graph    :as tg]
            [clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te]))

(defn- main
  [& args]
  ;; in-RAM graph database used here only for demonstration
  (let [g  (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
        p1 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "ClojureWerkz" :url "http://clojurewerkz.org"})
        p2 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "Titanium"     :url "http://titanium.clojurewerkz.org"})
        e  (tg/add-edge g p1 p2 "links" {:verified-on "February 11th, 2013"})]
    ;= {"verified-on" "February 11th, 2013"}
    (te/properties-of e)))
```

Note that returned maps always have strings as keys.

### Getting A Single Property

To get a single property value, use the same function as with verties,
`clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/property-of`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/property-of e :verified-on)
```

To get id of an edge, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/id-of`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/id-of e)
```

### Listing Property Names

It is possible to list edge property names using `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/property-names`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/property-names e)
```

### Mutating Properties

Edge properties are mutated exactly the same way as vertex properties.

To mutate one or more properties on a vertex, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/assoc!`, which
mimics [clojure.core/assoc!](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/assoc!):

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/assoc! e "verified-on" date)
```

To merge a map (or multiple maps) into the map of edge properties, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/merge!`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/merge! e {"verified-on" date})
```


### Unsetting Properties

To clear a property (set its value to `nil`), use `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/dissoc!`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/dissoc! e "status" "verified-on")
```

To clear all properties on an edge, there is `clojurewerkz.titanium.elements/clear!`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(te/clear! e)
```


## Removing Edges

To remove an edge, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/remove-edge` which takes
a graph instance and an edge:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [p1 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "ClojureWerkz" :url "http://clojurewerkz.org"})
      p2 (tg/add-vertex g {:title "Titanium"     :url "http://titanium.clojurewerkz.org"})
      e  (tg/add-edge g p1 p2 "links")]
  (tg/remove-edge g e))
```


## Fetching Vertices

To find a vertex by id (if it is known), use `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/get-vertex`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph    :as tg])
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(let [g  (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
      v1 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 28 :name "Michael"})
      v2 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 26 :name "Alex"})]
    (println (tg/get-vertex g (te/id-of v1))))
```

To find vertices by a key/value pair of properties, there is `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/get-vertices`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [g  (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
      v1 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 28 :name "Michael"})
      v2 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 26 :name "Alex"})
      xs (set (tg/get-vertices g "name" "Alex"))]
    (println xs))
```

To find all the graph vertices, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/get-vertices` with just
one argument, the graph:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [g  (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
      v1 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 28 :name "Michael"})
      v2 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 26 :name "Alex"})
      xs (set (tg/get-vertices g))]
    (println xs))
```


## Fetching Edges

The API part that finds edges is very similar to the one covered above that works
with vertices.

To find an edge by id (if it is known), use `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/get-edge`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph    :as tg])
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.elements :as te])

(let [g  (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
      v1 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 28 :name "Michael"})
      v2 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 26 :name "Alex"})
      e  (tg/add-edge g v1 v2 "friend")]
    (println (tg/get-edge g (te/id-of e))))
```

To find edges by a key/value pair of properties, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/get-vertices`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [g  (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
      v1 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 28 :name "Michael"})
      v2 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 26 :name "Alex"})
      e  (tg/add-edge g v1 v2 "friend" {:since 2008})
      xs (set (tg/get-edges g "since" 2008))]
    (println xs))
```

To find all the graph edges, use `clojurewerkz.titanium.graph/get-vertices` with just
one argument:

``` clojure
(require '[clojurewerkz.titanium.graph :as tg])

(let [g  (tg/open-in-memory-graph)
      v1 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 28 :name "Michael"})
      v2 (tg/add-vertex g {:age 26 :name "Alex"})
      e  (tg/add-edge g v1 v2 "friend" {:since 2008})
      xs (set (tg/get-edges g))]
    (println xs))
```
